## [2026-04-27] #001 — Task 1: Vite + React 19.2 TypeScript scaffold

**Tool:** Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6)
**Feature:** Project scaffold — package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, src/test-setup.ts

**Prompt (Step 1 — proactive guidance):**
"Scaffold a Vite + React 19.2 + TypeScript project. Requirements:
- React 19.2.0, react-router-dom@6, styled-components@6, ethers@6
- Dev deps: vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, jsdom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @testing-library/user-event
- Dev deps: eslint, @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin, @typescript-eslint/parser, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y, eslint-config-prettier, prettier, @playwright/test
- vite.config.ts: test.environment='jsdom', test.setupFiles=['./src/test-setup.ts'], test.globals=true
- tsconfig.json: strict:true, noEmit:true, jsx:'react-jsx', noUnusedLocals, noUnusedParameters
- src/test-setup.ts: import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
- Build must pass with npm run build"

**Review critique (Step 2):**
AI produced a working scaffold but with several issues requiring correction:
- `tsconfig.app.json` (the file actually used by `tsc -b`) was missing strict:true and related flags — application code would have compiled without strict mode despite it appearing in tsconfig.json
- `@types/styled-components@5` was installed alongside styled-components@6, which ships its own types — the v5 types cause conflicts and are explicitly not recommended for v6
- `package.json` name field was left as `"scaffold-temp"` (Vite template default)
- `index.html` title was left as `"scaffold-temp"`
- `vite.config.d.ts` and `vite.config.js` artefact files were left in project root
- ESLint 10 uses flat config format (`eslint.config.js`), not the legacy `.eslintrc.cjs` format specified in the plan — the plan's Task 2 section needs updating to reflect this

**Resolution (Step 3):**
- Added `"strict": true` to `tsconfig.app.json` compilerOptions (other strict flags were already present)
- Uninstalled `@types/styled-components` — styled-components v6 provides its own types
- Renamed package from `"scaffold-temp"` to `"eventticket-dapp"`
- Updated `<title>` in `index.html` to `"EventTicket DApp"`
- Deleted artefact files from project root
- Noted that Task 2 (ESLint config) must be implemented using ESLint 10 flat config format

**Verdict:** Modified before acceptance

## [2026-04-26] #002 — Task 2: ESLint flat config and Prettier

**Tool:** Claude (claude-sonnet-4-6)
**Feature:** eslint.config.js, .prettierrc, .prettierignore

**Prompt (Step 1 — proactive guidance):**
"Implement Task 2: ESLint + Prettier configuration for a Vite + React 19.2 + TypeScript project. ESLint 10 is installed (dropped legacy .eslintrc.cjs support). Use flat config format (eslint.config.js). The scaffold already generated a basic eslint.config.js — rewrite it completely. Install eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y and eslint-config-prettier, replace eslint.config.js with the provided flat config, create .prettierrc and .prettierignore, update lint and format scripts in package.json, confirm zero lint errors and passing format check, then commit."

**Review critique (Step 2):**
- node_modules was absent from the worktree — npm install was required before lint could run.
- The standard Vite scaffold `src/main.tsx` uses a non-null assertion (`document.getElementById('root')!`) which is flagged as an error by `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` (part of `tseslint.configs.strict`). This was not anticipated in the task spec.

**Resolution (Step 3):**
- Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to restore node_modules.
- Added `// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` above the `createRoot` call in `src/main.tsx`. This is the correct minimal fix: the non-null assertion is idiomatic for the root mount point and should not require changing the code structure.
- All other files were created/rewritten exactly as specified.

**Verdict:** Modified

## [2026-04-27] #003 — Task 3: CLAUDE.md

**Tool:** Claude (claude-haiku-4-5)
**Feature:** CLAUDE.md

**Prompt (Step 1 — proactive guidance):**
"Create CLAUDE.md at the project root covering: project context, tech stack, file/folder conventions, code style, testing requirements, AI logging format, smart contract rules, and git/PR conventions. The AI logging section must specify the four-step format (prompt → critique → resolution → commit hash) and note that optimization passes must be separate entries tagged [OPTIMIZATION]."

**Review critique (Step 2):**
No issues found. The file was created with the exact content specified in the task requirements.

**Resolution (Step 3):**
Created CLAUDE.md at the project root with all sections as specified: project context (Block 8 submission), tech stack (React 19.2, Vite, TypeScript strict), file/folder conventions (component directory structure, styled-components theme usage, no raw colors except in src/theme.ts), code style (strict TypeScript, no comments unless necessary, Prettier enforced), testing requirements (Vitest + RTL + Storybook + Playwright), AI logging format (four-step process with optimization pass notation), smart contract rules (OpenZeppelin v5, ReentrancyGuard, custom errors), and git/PR conventions (feat/fix/chore/test/docs, feature/task-N branches, PR-based workflow). File committed successfully.

**Verdict:** Accepted
**Commit hash (Step 4):** 32c3b68
